# The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play
Load, clean, and visualize scraped Google Play Store data to gain insights into the Android app market.

Mobile applications have become ubiquitous in today's digital landscape, and their creation is relatively straightforward, with the potential for significant financial gain. Consequently, an increasing number of apps are currently in development. This project focuses on conducting a thorough analysis of the Android app market, involving the comparison of more than ten thousand apps available on Google Play, spanning various categories. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from this dataset, enabling the formulation of effective growth and retention strategies.

The dataset used for this project has been collected by scraping information from the Google Play website. It is worth noting that while there are numerous popular datasets available for the Apple App Store, the same cannot be said for Google Play apps. The scarcity of such datasets for Google Play can be attributed, in part, to the more challenging nature of web scraping from this platform compared to its Apple counterpart. The data files included in this project are as follows:

1. "apps.csv" - This file comprises comprehensive details about the Google Play apps, encompassing various features that define each app.

2. "user_reviews.csv" - Within this file, you will find a collection of 100 reviews for each app, sorted in order of helpfulness. Furthermore, the text in each review has undergone preprocessing and sentiment analysis, with each review tagged with a corresponding sentiment score.
